A Python helper library for writing `Alfred 2`_ workflows.

Alfred workflows typically take user input, fetch data from the Web or
elsewhere, filter them and display results to the user. Alfred-Workflow
takes care of a lot of the details for you, allowing you to concentrate your
efforts on your workflow's functionality.

Features
========

* Catches and logs workflow errors for easier development and support
* "Magic" arguments to help development/debugging
* Auto-saves settings
* Super-simple data caching
* Fuzzy, Alfred-like search/filtering with diacritic folding
* Keychain support for secure storage (and syncing) of passwords, API keys etc.
* Simple generation of Alfred feedback (XML output)
* Input/output decoding for handling non-ASCII text
* Lightweight web API with modelled on `requests`_
* Pre-configured logging
* Painlessly add directories to ``sys.path``
* Easily launch background tasks (daemons) to keep your workflow responsive
* Check for new versions and update workflows hosted on GitHub.

Quick Example
=============

Here's how to show recent `Pinboard.in <https://pinboard.in/>`_ posts in Alfred.

Create a new workflow in Alfred's preferences. Add a **Script Filter** with
Language ``/usr/bin/python`` and paste the following into the **Script** field
(changing ``API_KEY``):

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    from workflow import Workflow, ICON_WEB, web

    API_KEY = 'your-pinboard-api-key'

    def main(wf):
        url = 'https://api.pinboard.in/v1/posts/recent'
        params = dict(auth_token=API_KEY, count=20, format='json')
        r = web.get(url, params)
        r.raise_for_status()
        for post in r.json()['posts']:
            wf.add_item(post['description'], post['href'], arg=post['href'],
                        uid=post['hash'], valid=True, icon=ICON_WEB)
        wf.send_feedback()


    if __name__ == u"__main__":
        wf = Workflow()
        sys.exit(wf.run(main))


Add an **Open URL** action to your workflow with ``{query}`` as the **URL**,
connect your **Script Filter** to it, and you can now hit **ENTER** on a
Pinboard item in Alfred to open it in your browser.

Installation
============

**Note**: If you intend to distribute your workflow to other users, you should
include Alfred-Workflow (and other Python libraries your workflow requires)
within your workflow's directory as described below. **Do not** ask users to
install anything into their system Python. Python installations cannot support
multiple versions of the same library, so if you rely on globally-installed
libraries, the chances are very good that your workflow will sooner or later
break—or be broken by—some other software doing the same naughty thing.

With pip
--------

You can install Alfred-Workflow directly into your workflow with::

    pip install --target=/path/to/my/workflow Alfred-Workflow

You can install any other library available on the `Cheese Shop`_ the
same way. See the `pip documentation`_ for more information.

From source
-----------

Download the ``alfred-workflow-X.X.X.zip`` file from the `GitHub releases`_ page
and either extract the ZIP to the root directory of your workflow (where
``info.plist`` is) or place the ZIP in the root directory and add
``sys.path.insert(0, 'alfred-workflow-X.X.X.zip')`` to the top of your
Python scripts.

Alternatively, you can download `the source code`_ from the `GitHub repository`_
and copy the ``workflow`` subfolder to the root directory of your workflow.

Your workflow directory should look something like this (where
``yourscript.py`` contains your workflow code and ``info.plist`` is
the workflow information file generated by Alfred)::

    Your Workflow/
        info.plist
        icon.png
        workflow/
            __init__.py
            background.py
            update.py
            version
            web.py
            workflow.py
        yourscript.py
        etc.


Or like this::

    Your Workflow/
        info.plist
        icon.png
        workflow-1.X.X.zip
        yourscript.py
        etc.
