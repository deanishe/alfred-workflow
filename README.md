## Installation ##

**Note**: If you intend to distribute your workflow to other users, you should
include Alfred-Workflow (and other Python libraries your workflow requires)
within your workflow's directory as described below. **Do not** ask users to
install anything into their system Python. Python installations cannot support
multiple versions of the same library, so if you rely on globally-installed
libraries, the chances are very good that your workflow will sooner or later
break—or be broken by—some other software doing the same naughty thing.

### With pip ###

You can install Alfred-Workflow directly into your workflow with:

```bash
pip install --target=/path/to/my/workflow Alfred-Workflow
```

You can install any other library available on the [Cheese Shop][cheeseshop] the same way. See the [pip documentation][pip-docs] for more information.

### From source ###

1. Download the `alfred-workflow-X.X.X.zip` from the
   [releases page][releases].
2. Either extract the ZIP archive and place the `workflow` directory in the
   root folder of your workflow (where `info.plist` is) **or**
3. Place the ZIP archive in the root folder of your workflow and add
   `sys.path.insert(0, 'alfred-workflow-X.X.X.zip')` at the top of your Python
   script(s).

Your workflow should look something like this:

    Your Workflow/
        info.plist
        icon.png
        workflow/
            __init__.py
            background.py
            update.py
            version
            web.py
            workflow.py
        yourscript.py
        etc.

Or this:

    Your Workflow/
        info.plist
        icon.png
        workflow-1.X.X.zip
        yourscript.py
        etc.

**Note:** the `background.py` module will not work from within a zip archive.

Alternatively, you can clone/download the Alfred-Workflow
[repository][repo] and copy the
`workflow` subdirectory to your workflow's root directory.

## Usage ##

A few examples of how to use Alfred-Workflow.

### Workflow script skeleton ###

Set up your workflow scripts as follows (if you wish to use the built-in error
handling or `sys.path` modification):

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# encoding: utf-8

import sys

from workflow import Workflow


def main(wf):
    # The Workflow instance will be passed to the function
    # you call from `Workflow.run`
    # Your imports here if you want to catch import errors
    # or if the modules/packages are in a directory added via `Workflow(libraries=...)`
    import somemodule
    import anothermodule
    # Get args from Workflow, already in normalised Unicode
    args = wf.args

    # Do stuff here ...

    # Add an item to Alfred feedback
    wf.add_item(u'Item title', u'Item subtitle')

    # Send output to Alfred
    wf.send_feedback()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    wf = Workflow()
    sys.exit(wf.run(main))
```

### Examples ###

Cache data for 30 seconds:

```python
def get_web_data():
    return web.get('http://www.example.com').json()

def main(wf):
    # Save data from `get_web_data` for 30 seconds under
    # the key ``example``
    data = wf.cached_data('example', get_web_data, max_age=30)
    for datum in data:
        wf.add_item(datum['title'], datum['author'])
    wf.send_feedback()
```

#### Web ####

Grab data from a JSON web API:

```python
data = web.get('http://www.example.com/api/1/stuff').json()
```

Post a form:

```python
r = web.post('http://www.example.com/', data={'artist': 'Tom Jones', 'song': "It's not unusual"})
```

Upload a file:

```python
files = {'fieldname' : {'filename': "It's not unusual.mp3",
                        'content': open("It's not unusual.mp3", 'rb').read()}
}
r = web.post('http://www.example.com/upload/', files=files)
```

**WARNING**: As this module is based on Python 2's standard HTTP libraries, it
*cannot* validate SSL certificates when making HTTPS connections. If your
workflow uses sensitive passwords/API keys, you should *strongly consider*
using the [requests][requests] library upon which the `web.py` API is based.

#### Keychain access ####

Save password:

```python
wf = Workflow()
wf.save_password('name of account', 'password1lolz')
```

Retrieve password:

```python
wf = Workflow()
wf.get_password('name of account')
```

## Contributing ##

### Adding a workflow to the list ###

If you want to add a workflow to the
[list of workflows using Alfred-Workflow](#workflows-using-alfred-workflow),
**don't add it to this README!** The list is automatically generated from
[Packal.org][packal] and the
[`library_workflows.tsv`](extras/library_workflows.tsv) file. If your workflow
is available on [Packal][packal], it should be added automatically. If not,
please add it to [`library_workflows.tsv`](extras/library_workflows.tsv),
instead of `README.md`, and submit a corresponding pull request.

### Bug reports, pull requests ###

Bug reports, feature suggestions and pull requests are very welcome. Head over
to the [issues][issues] if you have a feature request or a bug report.

If you want to make a pull request, do that [here][pulls], but please bear
the following in mind:

- Please open pull requests against the `develop` branch. I try to keep
  `master` in sync with the latest release (at least regarding any files
  included in releases). `master` and `develop` are *usually* in sync, but
  if I'm working on new features, they'll be in `develop` and won't be pushed
  to `master` until they're ready for release.
- Alfred-Workflow has very close to 100% test coverage. "Proof-of-concept"
  pull requests without tests are more than welcome. However, please be
  prepared to add the appropriate tests if you want your pull request to be
  ultimately accepted.
- Complete coverage is *only a proxy* for decent tests. Tests should also
  cover a decent variety of valid/invalid input. For example, if the code
  *could potentially* be handed non-ASCII input, it should be tested with
  non-ASCII input.
- Code should be [PEP8][pep8]-compliant as far as is reasonable. Any decent
  code editor has a PEP8 plugin that will warn you of potential transgressions.
- Please choose your function, method and argument names carefully, with an
  eye to the existing names. Obviousness is more important than brevity.
- Document your code using the [Sphinx ReST format][sphinx].
  Even if your function/method isn't user-facing, some other developer will be
  looking at it. Even if it's only a one-liner, the developer may be looking
  at [the docs][docs-api] in a browser, not at the source code.
- Performance counts. Alfred will try to run a workflow anew on every
  keypress. As a rule, 0.3 seconds execution time is decent, 0.2 seconds or
  less is smooth. Alfred-Workflow should do its utmost to consume as
  little of that time as possible.

Currently, there is Travis-CI integration, but also a `run-tests.sh` script in
the root directory of the repo which will fail *if code coverage is less than
100%* (Travis-CI also uses this script). Add `# pragma: no cover` with care.

## Tests ##

Alfred-Workflow includes a full suite of unit tests. Please use the
`run-tests.sh` script in the root directory of the repo to run the unit tests:
it creates the necessary test environment to run the unit tests.
`test_workflow.py` *will* fail if not run via `run-scripts.sh`, but the test
suites for the other modules may also be run directly.

Moreover, `run-tests.sh` checks the coverage of the unit tests and will fail if
it is below 100%.
