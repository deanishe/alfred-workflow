Alfred-Workflow
===============

A helper library in Python for authors of workflows for [Alfred 2 and 3][alfred].

[![Build Status][shield-travis]][travis] [![Coverage Status][shield-coveralls]][coveralls] [![Latest Version][shield-version]][pypi] [![Development Status][shield-status]][pypi] [![Supported Python Versions][shield-pyversions]][pypi]

<!-- [![Downloads][shield-download]][pypi] -->

Supports OS X 10.6+ and Python 2.6 and 2.7 (Alfred 3 is 10.9+/2.7 only).

Alfred-Workflow takes the grunt work out of writing a workflow by giving you the tools to create a fast and featureful Alfred workflow from an API, application or library in minutes.

The only library, in any language, that *always* supports all current Alfred features.

Features
--------

- Auto-saved settings API for your workflow
- Super-simple data caching
- Fuzzy filtering (with smart diacritic folding)
- Keychain support for secure storage of passwords, API keys etc.
- Simple generation of Alfred feedback (JSON/XML output)
- Input/output decoding for handling non-ASCII text
- Lightweight web API with [Requests][requests]-like interface
- Catches and logs workflow errors for easier development and support
- "Magic" arguments to help development/debugging
- Pre-configured logging
- Easily launch background tasks (daemons) to keep your workflow responsive
- Automatically check for workflow updates via GitHub releases
- Post notifications via Notification Center
- Painlessly add directories to `sys.path`


### Alfred 3-only features ###

- Set workflow variables from code
- Advanced modifiers
- Alfred 3-only updates (won't break Alfred 2 installs)
- Re-running of Script Filters

<a name="installation"></a>
Installation
------------

**Note**: If you intend to distribute your workflow to other users, you should include Alfred-Workflow (and other Python libraries your workflow requires) within your workflow's directory as described below. **Do not** ask users to install anything into their system Python. Python installations cannot support multiple versions of the same library, so if you rely on globally-installed libraries, the chances are very good that your workflow will sooner or later break—or be broken by—some other software doing the same naughty thing.


<a name="with-pip"></a>
### With pip ###

First, create a new blank workflow in Alfred (or choose an existing one if you wish). To navigate to your workflow directory in Terminal, right-click on your workflow and [click "Open in Terminal"](https://preview.ibb.co/guygvo/Screen_Shot_2018_05_25_at_11_18_35_AM.png).

You can install Alfred-Workflow directly into your workflow with:
```bash
# from your [workflow directory](https://preview.ibb.co/guygvo/Screen_Shot_2018_05_25_at_11_18_35_AM.png)
pip install --target=. Alfred-Workflow
```

You can install any other library available on the [Cheese Shop][cheeseshop] the same way. See the [pip documentation][pip-docs] for more information.

It is highly advisable to bundle all your workflow's dependencies with your workflow in this way. That way, it will "just work".


<a name="from-source"></a>
### From source ###

1. Download the `alfred-workflow-X.X.X.zip` from the [GitHub releases page][releases].
2. Extract the ZIP archive and place the `workflow` directory in the [root folder of your workflow](https://image.ibb.co/iQiWvo/Screen_Shot_2018_05_25_at_11_16_50_AM.png) (where `info.plist` is).

Your workflow should look something like this:

    Your Workflow/
        info.plist
        icon.png
        workflow/
            __init__.py
            background.py
            notify.py
            Notify.tgz
            update.py
            version
            web.py
            workflow.py
        yourscript.py
        etc.

Alternatively, you can clone/download the Alfred-Workflow [repository][repo] and copy the `workflow` subdirectory to your workflow's root directory.


<a name="usage"></a>
Usage
-----

A few examples of how to use Alfred-Workflow.


<a name="workflow-script-skeleton"></a>
### Workflow script skeleton ###

Set up your workflow scripts as follows (if you wish to use the built-in error handling or `sys.path` modification):

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# encoding: utf-8

import sys

# Workflow3 supports Alfred 3's new features. The `Workflow` class
# is also compatible with Alfred 2.
from workflow import Workflow3


def main(wf):
    # The Workflow3 instance will be passed to the function
    # you call from `Workflow3.run`.
    # Not super useful, as the `wf` object created in
    # the `if __name__ ...` clause below is global...
    #
    # Your imports go here if you want to catch import errors, which
    # is not a bad idea, or if the modules/packages are in a directory
    # added via `Workflow3(libraries=...)`
    import somemodule
    import anothermodule

    # Get args from Workflow3, already in normalized Unicode.
    # This is also necessary for "magic" arguments to work.
    args = wf.args

    # Do stuff here ...

    # Add an item to Alfred feedback
    wf.add_item(u'Item title', u'Item subtitle')

    # Send output to Alfred. You can only call this once.
    # Well, you *can* call it multiple times, but subsequent calls
    # are ignored (otherwise the JSON sent to Alfred would be invalid).
    wf.send_feedback()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create a global `Workflow3` object
    wf = Workflow3()
    # Call your entry function via `Workflow3.run()` to enable its
    # helper functions, like exception catching, ARGV normalization,
    # magic arguments etc.
    sys.exit(wf.run(main))
```


<a name="examples"></a>
### Examples ###

Cache data for 30 seconds:

```python
def get_web_data():
    return web.get('http://www.example.com').json()

def main(wf):
    # Save data from `get_web_data` for 30 seconds under
    # the key ``example``
    data = wf.cached_data('example', get_web_data, max_age=30)
    for datum in data:
        wf.add_item(datum['title'], datum['author'])

    wf.send_feedback()
```


<a name="web"></a>
#### Web ####

Grab data from a JSON web API:

```python
data = web.get('http://www.example.com/api/1/stuff').json()
```

Post a form:

```python
r = web.post('http://www.example.com/',
             data={'artist': 'Tom Jones', 'song': "It's not unusual"})
```

Upload a file:

```python
files = {'fieldname' : {'filename': "It's not unusual.mp3",
                        'content': open("It's not unusual.mp3", 'rb').read()}
}
r = web.post('http://www.example.com/upload/', files=files)
```

**WARNING**: As this module is based on Python 2's standard HTTP libraries, *on older versions of OS X/Python, it does not validate SSL certificates when making HTTPS connections*. If your workflow uses sensitive passwords/API keys, you should *strongly consider* using the [requests][requests] library upon which the `web.py` API is based.


<a name="keychain-access"></a>
#### Keychain access ####

Save password:

```python
wf = Workflow()
wf.save_password('name of account', 'password1lolz')
```

Retrieve password:

```python
wf = Workflow()
wf.get_password('name of account')
```

Licensing, thanks
-----------------

The code and the documentation are released under the MIT and [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial][cc] licences respectively. See [LICENCE.txt](LICENCE.txt) for details.

The documentation was generated using [Sphinx][sphinx] and a modified version of the [Alabaster][alabaster] theme by [bitprophet][bitprophet].

Many of the cooler ideas in Alfred-Workflow were inspired by [Alfred2-Ruby-Template][ruby-template] by Zhaocai.

The Keychain parser was based on [Python-Keyring][python-keyring] by Jason R. Coombs.

### Adding a workflow to the list ###

If you want to add a workflow to the [list of workflows using Alfred-Workflow](#workflows-using-alfred-workflow), **don't add it to this README!** The list is machine-generated from [Packal.org][packal] and the [`library_workflows.tsv`](extras/library_workflows.tsv) file. If your workflow is available on [Packal][packal], it will be added automatically. If not, please add it to [`library_workflows.tsv`](extras/library_workflows.tsv), instead of `README.md`, and submit a corresponding pull request.

The list is not auto-updated, so if you've released a workflow and are keen to see it in this list, please [open an issue][issues] asking me to update the list.


<a name="bug-reports-pull-requests"></a>
### Bug reports, pull requests ###

Bug reports, feature suggestions and pull requests are very welcome. Head over to the [issues][issues] if you have a feature request or a bug report.

**Please note:** that the only supported versions of Python are the Apple system Pythons installed on OS X 10.6+ (i.e. `/usr/bin/python`). Any pull requests that break compatibility with these Pythons will be rejected out of hand.

Compatibility with other Pythons is a very low priority. Pull requests adding compatibility with other Pythons will be rejected if they add significant complexity or additional dependencies, such as `six`.

If you want to make a pull request, do that [here][pulls], but please bear the following in mind:

- Please open pull requests against the `develop` branch. I try to keep `master` in sync with the latest release (at least regarding any files included in releases). `master` and `develop` are *usually* in sync, but if I'm working on new features, they'll be in `develop` and won't be pushed to `master` until they're ready for release.
- Alfred-Workflow has very close to 100% test coverage. "Proof-of-concept" pull requests without tests are more than welcome. However, please be prepared to add the appropriate tests if you want your pull request to be ultimately accepted.
- Complete coverage is *only a proxy* for decent tests. Tests should also cover a decent variety of valid/invalid input. For example, if the code *could potentially* be handed non-ASCII input, it should be tested with non-ASCII input.
- Code should be [PEP8][pep8]-compliant as far as is reasonable. Any decent code editor has a PEP8 plugin that will warn you of potential transgressions.
- Please choose your function, method and argument names carefully, with an eye to the existing names. Obviousness is more important than brevity.
- Document your code using the [Sphinx ReST format][sphinx]. Even if your function/method isn't user-facing, some other developer will be looking at it. Even if it's only a one-liner, the developer may be looking at [the docs][docs-api] in a browser, not at the source code.
  If you don't feel comfortable writing English, I'd be happy to write the docs for you, but please ensure the code is easily understandable (i.e. comment the code if it's not totally obvious).
- Performance counts. By default, Alfred will try to run a workflow anew on every keypress. As a rule, 0.3 seconds execution time is decent, 0.2 seconds or less is smooth. Alfred-Workflow should do its utmost to consume as little of that time as possible.

The main entry point for unit testing is the `run-tests.sh` script in the root directory. This will fail *if code coverage is < 100%*. Travis-CI also uses this script. Add `# pragma: no cover` with care.

<a name="tests"></a>
Tests
-----

Alfred-Workflow includes a full suite of unit tests. Please use the `run-tests.sh` script in the root directory of the repo to run the unit tests: it creates the necessary test environment to run the unit tests. `test_workflow.py` *will* fail if not run via `run-scripts.sh`, but the test suites for the other modules may also be run directly.

Moreover, `run-tests.sh` checks the coverage of the unit tests and will fail if it is below 100%.
