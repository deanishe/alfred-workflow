Supports Alfred 3 and Alfred 4 on macOS 10.7+ (Python 2.7).

Alfred-Workflow takes the grunt work out of writing a workflow by giving you the tools to create a fast and featureful Alfred workflow from an API, application or library in minutes.

Always supports all current Alfred features.

--------

- Auto-saved settings API for your workflow
- Super-simple data caching with expiry
- Fuzzy filtering (with smart diacritic folding)
- Keychain support for secure storage of passwords, API keys etc.
- Lightweight web API with [Requests][requests]-like interface
- Background tasks to keep your workflow responsive
- Simple generation of Alfred JSON feedback
- Full support of Alfred's AppleScript/JXA API
- Catches and logs workflow errors for easier development and support
- "Magic" arguments to help development/debugging
- Unicode support
- Pre-configured logging
- Automatically check for workflow updates via GitHub releases
- Post notifications via Notification Center


### Alfred 4+ features ###

- Advanced modifiers

<a name="installation"></a>
Installation
------------

**Note**: If you're new to Alfred workflows, check out
[the tutorial][docs-tutorial] in the docs.


<a name="with-pip"></a>
### With pip ###

You can install Alfred-Workflow directly into your workflow with:

```bash
# from your workflow directory
pip install --target=. Alfred-Workflow
```

You can install any other library available on the [Cheese Shop][cheeseshop] the same way. See the [pip documentation][pip-docs] for more information.

It is highly advisable to bundle all your workflow's dependencies with your workflow in this way. That way, it will "just work".

<a name="from-source"></a>
### From source ###

1. Download the `alfred-workflow-X.X.X.zip` from the [GitHub releases page][releases].
2. Extract the ZIP archive and place the `workflow` directory in the root folder of your workflow (where `info.plist` is).

Your workflow should look something like this:

    Your Workflow/
        info.plist
        icon.png
        workflow/
            __init__.py
            background.py
            notify.py
            Notify.tgz
            update.py
            version
            web.py
            workflow.py
        yourscript.py
        etc.

Alternatively, you can clone/download the Alfred-Workflow [repository][repo] and copy the `workflow` subdirectory to your workflow's root directory.

<a name="python-2-support-on-macos-123"></a>
### Python 2 support on macOS 12.3+ ###

Python 2 was [removed in macOS 12.3](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12_3-release-notes#:~:text=Python%202.7%20was%20removed%20from%20macOS%20in%20this%20update). Users that run macOS 12.3 or newer will have to [install Python 2.7.18 manually](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/).
Additionally, the following code needs to be added to the `info.plist` file after `<plist><dict>`:

```xml
<key>variables</key>
<dict>
    <key>PATH</key>
    <string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin</string>
</dict>
```

This is required because Alfred doesn't inherit environment variables and doesn't source shell configuration files (such as `.zshrc`).

Usage
-----

A few examples of how to use Alfred-Workflow.


<a name="workflow-script-skeleton"></a>
### Workflow script skeleton ###

Set up your workflow scripts as follows (if you wish to use the built-in error handling or `sys.path` modification):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# encoding: utf-8

import sys

# Workflow3 supports Alfred 3's new features. The `Workflow` class
# is also compatible with Alfred 2.
from workflow import Workflow3


def main(wf):
    # The Workflow3 instance will be passed to the function
    # you call from `Workflow3.run`.
    # Not super useful, as the `wf` object created in
    # the `if __name__ ...` clause below is global...
    #
    # Your imports go here if you want to catch import errors, which
    # is not a bad idea, or if the modules/packages are in a directory
    # added via `Workflow3(libraries=...)`
    import somemodule
    import anothermodule

    # Get args from Workflow3, already in normalized Unicode.
    # This is also necessary for "magic" arguments to work.
    args = wf.args

    # Do stuff here ...

    # Add an item to Alfred feedback
    wf.add_item(u'Item title', u'Item subtitle')

    # Send output to Alfred. You can only call this once.
    # Well, you *can* call it multiple times, but subsequent calls
    # are ignored (otherwise the JSON sent to Alfred would be invalid).
    wf.send_feedback()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create a global `Workflow3` object
    wf = Workflow3()
    # Call your entry function via `Workflow3.run()` to enable its
    # helper functions, like exception catching, ARGV normalization,
    # magic arguments etc.
    sys.exit(wf.run(main))
```


<a name="examples"></a>
### Examples ###

Cache data for 30 seconds:

```python
def get_web_data():
    return web.get('http://www.example.com').json()

def main(wf):
    # Save data from `get_web_data` for 30 seconds under
    # the key ``example``
    data = wf.cached_data('example', get_web_data, max_age=30)
    for datum in data:
        wf.add_item(datum['title'], datum['author'])

    wf.send_feedback()
```


<a name="web"></a>
#### Web ####

Grab data from a JSON web API:

```python
data = web.get('http://www.example.com/api/1/stuff').json()
```

Post a form:

```python
r = web.post('http://www.example.com/',
             data={'artist': 'Tom Jones', 'song': "It's not unusual"})
```

Upload a file:

```python
files = {'fieldname' : {'filename': "It's not unusual.mp3",
                        'content': open("It's not unusual.mp3", 'rb').read()}
}
r = web.post('http://www.example.com/upload/', files=files)
```

**WARNING**: As this module is based on Python 2's standard HTTP libraries, *on old versions of OS X/Python, it does not validate SSL certificates when making HTTPS connections*. If your workflow uses sensitive passwords/API keys, you should *strongly consider* using the [requests][requests] library upon which the `web.py` API is based.


<a name="keychain-access"></a>
#### Keychain access ####

Save password:

```python
wf = Workflow()
wf.save_password('name of account', 'password1lolz')
```

Retrieve password:

```python
wf = Workflow()
wf.get_password('name of account')
```

### Adding a workflow to the list ###

If you want to add a workflow to the [list of workflows using Alfred-Workflow][docs-workflows], **don't add it to the docs!** The list is machine-generated from [Packal.org][packal] and the [`library_workflows.tsv`](extras/library_workflows.tsv) file. If your workflow is available on [Packal][packal], it will be added on the next update. If not, please add it to [`library_workflows.tsv`](extras/library_workflows.tsv), and submit a corresponding pull request.

The list is not auto-updated, so if you've released a workflow and are keen to see it in this list, please [open an issue][issues] asking me to update the list.
