General:
	- Move workflow into top-level directory to allow use as a Git submodule.
		Is this necessary? I have to copy stuff hither and thither all the time, but
		I'm the one developing the workflow package. Will this be such a problem for
		other developers?

		In this case, where would the docs go? They don't exist yet, but should, and
		including them in the workflow package would be antithetical to what I'm
		trying to achieve. They would just be a duplication of the comments in the
		source code in any case.
	- Add `setup.py` so `Alfred-Workflow` can be added to PyPi and installed with `pip`

web.py:
workflow.py:
	- automatically add `lib` and/or `packages` subdirectory to `sys.path`?
	- move "magic" args to class-level dictionary, so authors can add their own.
	- optimise `filter` by memoising expensive operations, e.g. `pattern`/`search` generation @done(14-05-11 23:13)
	ui.py:
	Possibly provide access to dialog boxes, notifications w/out having to use AppleScript
	- Yes/no dialog
	- Text input
	- Select list
	- Notification center notifications
	search.py:
		Interface to `mdfind`
Docs:
	- Add tutorial using `workflow.web`
	- Add tutorial using filesystem/Unicode
